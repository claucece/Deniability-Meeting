# Welcome to the Deniability Meeting!

Find me on [github](https://github.com/claucece/Deniability-Meeting)!

This is an informal meeting to be held at [Real World Crypto 2021](https://rwc.iacr.org/2021/).

What is an informal meeting? It is a far-less planned meeting where people interested
in the topic come together and discuss ideas!

What is the topic? The topic is Deniability, the fun property that allows
participants in a protocol to deny having executed an action to anyone but
themselves.

We held a similar event on RWC2020, so this is a deniable tradition now!

This form takes inspiration from the [pl-hci-school-2020](https://shriram.github.io/pl-hci-school-2020/)
organized by Sarah Chasins, Elena Glassman, Shriram Krishnamurthi and Hila Peleg,
and by the [Fourteenth Algorithmic Number Theory Symposium, ANTS-XIV](https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~sgal018/ANTS/index.html)
organized by Steven Galbraith.

# Information
